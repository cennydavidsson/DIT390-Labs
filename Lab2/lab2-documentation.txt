The monitor have an interface of three methods and works simerly to a binary semaphore. The methods are described below.

enter()
  This method locks the track.

tryEnter()
  This methods checks if the track is loked, if not locked it locks it. It also returns an boolean if the lock was successful.

leave()
  This method unlocks the monitor.

The monitor only uses one condition variable as we are only interested if the track is occupied, to keep track if the track is occupied we use a boolean value, and call signal or wait depending on this variable.
